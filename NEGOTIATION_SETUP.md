# AI-to-AI Negotiation Agent - Setup & Quick Start

## What We Built

An **autonomous AI-powered negotiation system** that enables AI companies to programmatically negotiate content licensing terms with publishers. The system uses LLMs (GPT-4, Claude) to conduct multi-round negotiations on behalf of publishers, automatically reaching agreements and generating licenses.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

```
AI Company (via MCP)
    ‚Üì
MCP Server (propose_terms, counter_offer, accept_terms)
    ‚Üì
Negotiation Engine (LLM-powered)
    ‚Üì
Database (negotiations, rounds, strategies)
    ‚Üì
License Generator ‚Üí Policy Created
```

**Key Components:**
- **negotiation-agent/** - New service with MCP server & negotiation engine
- **Database migration** - `009_negotiation_system.sql`
- **Docker Compose** - Service integrated and ready to run
- **Test script** - `test-negotiation.ps1` for end-to-end testing

---

## üì¶ What's Included

### New Service: `negotiation-agent/`

```
negotiation-agent/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ server.js              # Main Express + REST API
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ mcp-server.js          # MCP protocol server
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ negotiation-engine.js  # Core LLM negotiation logic
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ license-generator.js   # Convert terms ‚Üí policies
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ llm-provider.js        # OpenAI/Anthropic abstraction
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ db.js                  # PostgreSQL client
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ redis.js               # Redis client
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ logger.js              # Winston logging
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Dockerfile
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md
```

### Database Tables

1. **`negotiation_strategies`** - Publisher negotiation preferences
2. **`negotiations`** - Active/completed negotiation sessions
3. **`negotiation_rounds`** - Full audit trail of each round
4. **`negotiation_messages`** - Optional conversational logs

---

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Step 1: Run Database Migration

```powershell
# Make sure services are up
docker-compose up -d postgres

# Run the migration
docker-compose exec postgres psql -U tollbit -d tollbit -f /docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/migrations/009_negotiation_system.sql
```

**Or manually:**

```powershell
Get-Content .\database\migrations\009_negotiation_system.sql | docker exec -i tollbit-postgres psql -U tollbit -d tollbit
```

### Step 2: Set API Keys

You need an OpenAI or Anthropic API key for the LLM negotiation engine:

```powershell
# Windows PowerShell
$env:OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."
$env:ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-ant-..."

# Or add to docker-compose.yml environment section
```

### Step 3: Build & Start Service

```powershell
# Build and start
docker-compose up -d --build negotiation-agent

# Check logs
docker-compose logs -f negotiation-agent

# Verify it's running
curl.exe http://localhost:3003/health
```

### Step 4: Run Test Script

```powershell
.\test-negotiation.ps1
```

This will:
1. ‚úÖ List available publishers
2. ‚úÖ Get publisher negotiation strategy
3. ‚úÖ Propose initial terms (as AI company)
4. ‚úÖ Receive counter-offer from publisher's AI agent
5. ‚úÖ Submit counter-proposal
6. ‚úÖ Accept terms (or continue negotiating)
7. ‚úÖ Generate license from agreement
8. ‚úÖ View analytics

## üéØ How It Works

### 1. **Publisher Sets Strategy**

```sql
-- Already seeded in migration
SELECT * FROM negotiation_strategies WHERE publisher_id = 1;
```

Defines:
- Price boundaries ($0.001 - $0.005)
- Negotiation style (aggressive, balanced, flexible, cooperative)
- Auto-accept threshold (e.g., 90% of preferred terms)
- Deal breakers (auto-reject conditions)
- LLM configuration (GPT-4, Claude, etc.)

### 2. **AI Company Proposes Terms** (via MCP)

```javascript
// AI company calls MCP tool
await mcp.callTool('propose_license_terms', {
  publisher_hostname: 'site-a.local',
  client_name: 'OpenAI',
  proposed_terms: {
    price_per_fetch_micro: 1500,  // $0.0015
    token_ttl_seconds: 600,
    burst_rps: 10,
    purposes: ['inference']
  }
});
```

### 3. **Publisher's AI Agent Evaluates** (Automatic)

The negotiation engine:
1. **Loads strategy** for the publisher
2. **Checks deal breakers** ‚Üí Auto-reject if violated
3. **Scores proposal** against preferred terms (0.0 - 1.0)
4. **Auto-accept** if score ‚â• threshold (e.g., 90%)
5. **Generates counter-offer** using LLM if not accepted

**LLM Prompt Example:**

```
You are negotiating on behalf of Publisher A.

Current Proposal:
- Price: $0.0015 per fetch
- TTL: 600 seconds
- RPS: 10
- Purpose: inference

Your Strategy:
- Min Price: $0.001
- Preferred Price: $0.002
- Style: balanced

Generate a counter-offer that moves toward your preferred terms.
Consider: this is round 1 of max 10 rounds.
```

**LLM Response:**

```json
{
  "price_per_fetch_micro": 1900,
  "token_ttl_seconds": 600,
  "burst_rps": 10,
  "purposes": ["inference"],
  "reasoning": "Your proposal is close to our preferred terms. We're willing to accept the TTL and RPS, but need a slightly higher price to cover our content costs. This is a fair middle ground.",
  "tone": "friendly"
}
```

### 4. **Multi-Round Negotiation**

Continues until:
- ‚úÖ **Accepted** - Terms meet threshold or AI company accepts
- ‚ùå **Rejected** - Deal breaker violated
- ‚è±Ô∏è **Timeout** - Max rounds exceeded or time limit reached

### 5. **License Generation**

```javascript
// After acceptance
POST /api/negotiations/{id}/generate-license

// Returns generated policy
{
  "policy_id": 123,
  "policy_json": {
    "rules": [{
      "agent": "OpenAI",
      "allow": true,
      "price_per_fetch": 0.0018,
      "purpose": ["inference"],
      ...
    }]
  }
}
```

# 1. List publishers
curl.exe http://localhost:3003/api/publishers

# 2. Propose terms
curl.exe -X POST http://localhost:3003/api/negotiations/initiate `
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" `
  -d '{
    "publisher_hostname": "site-a.local",
    "client_name": "TestAI",
    "proposed_terms": {
      "price_per_fetch_micro": 1500,
      "purposes": ["inference"]
    }
  }'

# 3. Get status
curl.exe http://localhost:3003/api/negotiations/{id}

# 4. Counter-offer
curl.exe -X POST http://localhost:3003/api/negotiations/counter `
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" `
  -d '{
    "negotiation_id": "{id}",
    "counter_terms": {
      "price_per_fetch_micro": 1800,
      "purposes": ["inference"]
    }
  }'

# 5. Generate license
curl.exe -X POST http://localhost:3003/api/negotiations/{id}/generate-license
```

### Automated Test

```powershell

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Service won't start

```powershell
# Check logs
docker-compose logs negotiation-agent

# Common issues:
# - Missing API keys ‚Üí Set OPENAI_API_KEY or ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
# - Database not ready ‚Üí Wait for postgres to fully start
# - Port conflict ‚Üí Change PORT in docker-compose.yml
```

### LLM not responding

```powershell
# Test API key
curl https://api.openai.com/v1/models -H "Authorization: Bearer $env:OPENAI_API_KEY"

# Check logs for errors
docker-compose logs -f negotiation-agent | Select-String "LLM"
```

### Migration issues

```powershell
# Check if migration ran
docker-compose exec postgres psql -U tollbit -d tollbit -c "\dt negotiation*"

# Re-run migration
docker-compose exec postgres psql -U tollbit -d tollbit -f /path/to/009_negotiation_system.sql
```
