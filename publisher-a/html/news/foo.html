        <h2>Breaking: New AI Licensing Framework Announced</h2>
        <div class="meta">

        <div class="content">
            <p><strong>SAN FRANCISCO</strong> â€” A groundbreaking new framework for AI content licensing 
            has been unveiled today, promising to transform how publishers monetize their content 
            in the age of large language models.</p>

            <p>The "Gatehouse" system, demonstrated through an open-source educational MVP, implements 
            a three-tier access model that distinguishes between human readers, unlicensed AI bots, 
            and properly licensed AI systems.</p>

            <p>"This is about fairness and sustainability," said Dr. Sarah Chen, chief architect of 
            the project. "Publishers invest significant resources in creating quality content. When 
            AI systems use that content for training or inference, there should be a transparent, 
            frictionless way to ensure fair compensation."</p>

            <h3>How It Works</h3>
            
            <p>The system operates at the edge, intercepting requests before they reach origin servers. 
            Human visitors experience no difference in access, while AI bots must obtain short-lived 
            tokens through a licensing gateway.</p>

            <p>The framework supports multiple pricing models, including per-fetch fees, subscription 
            plans, and usage-based tiers. Publishers retain full control over their policies, including 
            which AI systems can access their content and for what purposes.</p>

            <h3>Industry Response</h3>

            <p>Early response from publishers has been overwhelmingly positive. "We've been looking 
            for a solution like this," noted James Wilson, CTO of MediaCorp. "It's not about blocking 
            AIâ€”it's about enabling it responsibly."</p>

            <p>AI companies have also expressed support. "We're happy to pay for quality data sources," 
            said Maria Rodriguez, head of data partnerships at a leading AI lab. "Having a standardized 
            framework makes this much easier to implement at scale."</p>

            <h3>What's Next</h3>

            <p>The educational MVP is available now as open source, with production-ready implementations 
            expected to launch in early 2026. Several major CDN providers have already announced plans 
            to integrate similar functionality into their edge computing platforms.</p>

            <p>For publishers interested in implementing the system, comprehensive documentation and 
            deployment guides are available on GitHub.</p>
